### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
A Python script has been created to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City and Washington.

The Python script imports the data of these three cities and takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal hat answers questions about the dataset.

The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions will change. There are four questions that will change the answers:

1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If the filter month is chosen:) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If the filter day is chosen:) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

Based on the userâ€™s answer on above four questions, code has been written to provide information on the following topics:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    - most common month
    - most common day of week
    - most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
    - most common start station
    - most common end station
    - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration
    - total travel time
    - average travel time
4. User info
    - counts of each user type
    - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
